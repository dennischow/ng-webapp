The service will offer templates and a site builder price comparison tool, which includes partners like Shopify, Squarespace, Wix and Weebly. For other third-party site developers (such as WordPress), you’ll have to manually set the resource codes.\n\nWith Google Domains, you’ll be able to buy and sell domains through the service, as well as create up to 100 email addresses under one domain. The service also offers to keep your registration private for no extra cost, and runs on Google’s DNS server to help your site load swiftly.\n\nGoogle says it is adding new generic top-level domains (gTLDs) regularly. Currently, the available options include .coffee, .academy, .company, .us and .ninja.

Just scroll with your fingers to peer around the video scene. While it can be a little odd, if you’re a business trying to display a 360-degree video, this is an eye catching solution.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/v4H8vW8ejhQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nThe display is available in 600mm, 760mm and 900mm diameters. The acrylic display uses a DLL projector shooting out 8,000 lumens.

We wish you a great new year 2015.\n\nHere are some predictions of the trends in web design for 2015 that we have gathered. We think that web design is at a crucial junction, still taking its design inspiration from traditional TV/cinema screen design and conventional press layout such as newspaper or magazines. Can TV and press design combine or will web design explore news ways for 2015?\n\n<h3>Responsiveness will bring Omnipresence</h3>\n\nWhat all web designers agree on is responsive web design. Responsive web design is almost magical. Why Magical? Contrary to other media, be it a film or a magazine, they both need to be viewed on a device with a standardised size (television set, 16.9, A4). Responsive web design is magical because it can virtually adapt to any device sizes, turning into the omnipresent media.\n\nWe forecast that the web will become the unique media source that will feed the others.\n\n<h3>Simple, flat, wide or fixed</h3>\n\nAlthough flat design is quite an old concept already, a lot of designers think it is here to stay and even increase in popularity. While some say web sites will become simpler and large header background images will disappear, others say that full screen images and videos will become more popular. The Next Web goes further and thinks that fixed width centred layout will take over. This means that the web is still hesitating between cinematographic and press layout.\n\nWe think the web will keep both trends in parallel, but norms will emerge such as entertainment related content heading towards tv/cinema layout and others going towards a fixed width content, like books or newspapers.\n\n<h3>Scroll to trawl or click to skip</h3>\n\nDo you prefer scrolling or clicking? Some web designers think it is easier for us to scroll instead of clicking. We think that clicking on a scrollbar or a link is the quintessence of the web, at least on a desktop computer. In an extremely fast paced media world, we believe clicking is like saying: “ok, that’s interesting, show me more”. It’s like seeing a nice shop and opening the door, or seeing your favourite magazine telling you to go on page 5 to read more about the story that’s advertised on their Front Page. Or like a book, having to turn pages to read on the story. So clicking to go down, up or to another page is not a real concern.\n\nParallax websites, or websites that have one single page with fancy effects when you scroll, have been here for a while now. Some believe the trend will increase. Although we think it’s quite a cool trend, we also think it is not user friendly, users have to click, then scroll back up because they missed something. It can be confusing and give headaches. That’s why most e-commerce and institutional websites don’t use this technique at all.\n\n<h3>Looking for uniqueness</h3>\n\nSome think in 2015 both the DIY and bespoke approach to web design will continue to grow but the bespoke design agencies will move further away from the templated ones in order to differentiate themselves further. If you have heard of Bootstrap or Wordpress templates, it might be time to rethink your website.\n\n<h3>Typography gives personality</h3>\n\nEveryone agrees on the increasing importance of typography, becoming larger and more carefully chosen, instead of the default Arial/Verdana. Strangely enough, nobody thinks the opposite and we think it’s a good thing.\n\nSome relatively new techniques are emerging such as SVG, sort of vector images for the web, useful for responsive images as they can scale to the screen size, but this will not radically revolutionise web design.\n\nWe don’t predict any radical changes for 2015, except a change leaning towards simplicity, users and content. Web design will still be influenced by tv and press design.\n\nSource : <a href=\"https://www.aegircreative.com/blog/web-design-trends-for-2015\" target=\"_blank\">Aegir Creative</a>",

It takes a photograph every 30 seconds and, once uploaded to Narrative’s servers, these images are assembled into ‘moments’ that capture the most visually interesting parts of your day.\n\nOne big problem with the original Clip was its reliance on being connected to a computer to adjust settings and upload photos. With this in mind, a big boon with version 2 is Wi-Fi sync and Bluetooth connectivity.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Narrative-Clip-2-render-520x364.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Narrative Clip render\" />\n\nThe device can automatically log into one assigned Wi-Fi network whenever it’s in range, uploading images automatically. While you’re on the go, you can view recently taken photos and adjust settings from your phone over Bluetooth.\n\nAdditionally, the sensor has been upgraded from 5 megapixels to 8 megapixels, and there’s a new 90-degree lens, promising  improved light sensitivity in low light conditions. There’s also a new modular clip designed to allow more attachment options, such as on a necklace or pinned to a shirt.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/Narrative-Clip-2-renders-730x345.jpg\" alt=\"picture of clip cam\" />\n\nOn the software side, Narrative’s iOS, Android and desktop Web apps will be updated with a public timeline, so you can share your best images with other users.\n\nI was impressed when I reviewed the original version of the Clip. Its ability to capture life in a unique way had me hooked for a few months, and even got me in trouble at an airport. Version 2’s reduced reliance on hooking up to a computer should make this a more compelling device. As with most wearable devices, the friction around ‘charge and sync’ relegated the original to staying unworn in my bag after a while.\n\nThere’s no release date set for the Narrative Clip 2 yet, but it will cost $199 at launch, as opposed to the original device’s current $149 price point. Color options at launch will be black, white and red.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinSFP\" target=\"_blank\">Martin Bryant</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2015/01/04/narratives-clip-2-wearable-camera-will-boast-wi-fi-sync-bluetooth-8-megpixel-camera/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

Okay, maybe that's not always true but none the less you want to make sure there's a banana (banana being the key element you want your users to look at) to grab their attention.\n\nYou also want to make sure that visually your website has a hierarchy and is broken down in order of 'importance'. Call to actions, H1s and H2s will fall under the more important elements, then H3s, H4s and links, then paragraph text and other images towards the bottom of the scale.\n\nA user should be able to look at a page and instantly recognise this hierarchy. Now here's a useful way to check if your hierarchy is as clear as you hope it is.\n\n<strong>Blur your vision</strong>\n\nUsually after designing a website I'll use this technique to check for visual hierarchy. Look at the website and blur your vision. Yep, sounds a bit weird, but what you're trying to see is if the elements you want to stand out still stand out.\n\n<strong>Blur your screenshot</strong>\n\nSo that your eyes don't get sore and to give you a bit more time to analyse it, take a screenshot of your website, bring it into Photoshop and give it a Gaussian Blur (Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur) of 5px.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/picture-5.png\" alt=\"picture of image with 5px blur in photoshop\" />\n\nHere are the results : \n\n<img src=\"http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/wufoo.jpg\" alt=\"picture blur example 001\" />\n\n<img src=\"http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/37.jpg\" alt=\"picture of blur example 002\" />\n\n<img src=\"http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/fowd2.jpg\" alt=\"picture of blur example 003\" />\n\n<strong>Does it work?</strong>\n\nIf you find you need to improve the visual hierarchy for different elements you can alter the following.\n\nSize, Contrast, Colour, Shape, Position, Whitespace and padding. You could go one better and blur the screenshot by 10 pixels to see if your 'banana' still sticks out.\n\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.leemunroe.com/visual-hierarchy/\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Munroe</a>",

Now, data from save-for-later reading and video app Pocket finds that indeed, users of Apple’s newest, larger smartphones do spend more time perusing their saved content on their iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, even when they also own and use an iPad.\n\nThe data gathered by pocket is drawn from the millions of articles, videos and other items from the web saved by users to their platform every day, and this particular study used a sample pool of over 2 million “opens” of articles and videos, comparing behavior specifically for users who upgraded from the iPhone 5 and 5s to either an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, to see if there was any observable change in their behaviour before and after the switch.\n\nPocket found that among users who upgraded to iPhone 6, they now spend 72 percent of their reading time on their smartphone, vs. just 28 percent on their iPad, which compares to 55 percent of their time spend on the iPhone 5s prior to the switch. iPhone 6 Plus users leaned even more heavily on their large smartphones for reading, spending 80 percent of their time on their iPhone, and only 20 percent on the iPad.\n\nUsers with the new 6 Plus opened a whopping 65 percent more items on their device than they did on the iPhone 5/5s they upgraded from, and iPhone 6 owners opened 33 percent more content, which means that users were not only preferring their smartphones to their tablets for content consumption, they were also just more likely to consume content in general.\n\nPocket’s data suggests that users are eager to pick up larger-screened devices when it’s time to read or watch, but it’s also possible these numbers are skewed by the kind of early excitement that comes with any new device – people always lavish the most attention on their newest toys, after all. But this is one of the first solid data-driven indicators that new big-screened iPhones could be cannibalizing iPad sales, so it’s worth watching to see how these numbers evolve over time.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drizzled\" target=\"_blank\">Darrell Etherington</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/26/iphone-6-and-6-plus-are-shifting-reading-away-from-ipad-study-finds/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>",

He found a demand among men wanting similar wearable lifelike suits and FemSkins was born.\n\nThe company now caters to approximately 400,000 transgender and cross-dressing people across the world and Adam also creates custom designs for customers with burns or scars but refuses to create masks, as he believes these would look too unrealistic.\n\n<img src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/33d96733f95f1705af657f74a2e35edd/200367366/female+doll+cropped+3.jpg\" alt=\"picture of a Rubber Dolls on the seat\" />\n\nRoby, a retired estate agent, is one of the company's best customers and spends his time in these full-length female body suits as a 'living doll'. Roby recently stepped out in Newport Beach wearing a 'yellow bikini' skin, which weighs around 12 pounds and is apparently comfortable enough to wear for hours.\n\n<img src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/9bc0e469cce7399f1b6f486f08f9f85a/200367349/Cropped.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Rubber Dolls\" />\n\nFor a man who spends so much of his time dressed as a doll, surprisingly, Roby has two daughters. In a recent interview with Barcroft Media, he revealed he only fantasising about having a female body in his 50s.\n\nQuote : Rhiannon Davies\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.mydaily.co.uk/2014/07/04/dressing-up-as-rubber-dolls-since-when-was-this-a-trend/\" target=\"_blank\">MyDailyUK</a>",

The firm’s <a href=\"http://www.parrot.com/usa/products/bebop-drone/\" target=\"_blank\">Bebop drone</a> will hit stores next month with a starting price of $500. That’s several hundred less than DJI’s entry-level Phantom drone even though it packs the same quality camera and several novel tricks including being controllable from a smartphone or tablet..\n\nThe Bebop is a big upgrade from the cheaper AR Drone, which, in part, helped install drones in the public’s mindset. Like with the AR Drone before it, Parrot equipped serious drone technology in the Bebop yet managed to keep the price down and safe to fly indoors.\n\nCompared to the similar DJI Phantom, the Bebop packs a lot of the same flight capabilities. And with the more expensive range extender controller, the Bebop has about the same range, too, with a 2 kilometer limit. The drone is capable of streaming the captured video back to a smartphone and it uses built-in GPS and downward facing cameras to help keep the drone in place during high-altitude flying.\n\nThe Bebop relies on a software-based 3-axis image stabilization to keep the image fixed and without distortion. Parrot explains the system take the image captured by the 14MP camera and cuts out the stable part, throwing away the bits on the edge that show the drone’s movement. This allows for the camera to be packed into the Bebop’s sleek body rather than dangling underneath.\n\n<img src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/parrot_bebopdrone_skycontroller3.jpg?w=680&h=480\" alt=\"picture of parrot drone\" />\n\nParrot also developed a dedicated controller for the Bebop that extends the Bebop’s range from 200 meets to 2 kilometers and allows for the pilot to view the drone’s camera output in AR glasses including the Oculus Rift. The controller amplifies the connected smartphone or tablet’s wifi signal and provides analog joysticks and buttons for more precise control. But this extra fun comes at a price: A Bebop with the SkyController costs $900.\n\nBoth the standard and SkyController editions will hit Best Buy and Apple stores in December for $500 and $900, respectively.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjburnsy\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Burns</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/19/parrots-14mp-bebop-drone-to-take-flight-in-december-for-500/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a>",

        "blog_body": "The original terracotta warriors and horses of Xi'an, China are over 2,300 years old, even if their existence was only discovered in the 1970s. That means they occupy a curious place in the culture. They're important historic artifacts, but they also spent a good 23 centuries lost and buried before they were unearthed in 1974 by farmers and excavated by archaeologists. \n\nThat unusual role makes them a subject of a lot of fascination for artists around the world—and that includes American sculptor Lizabeth Eva Rossof, whose Xi'an-America Warriors series offers a new take on the terracotta army: namely, one with the heads of Batman, Spider-Man, Bart Simpson, Mickey Mouse, and Shrek.\n\n<img src=\"http://e.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/11/3038541-inline-i-1-build-yourself-a-pop-culture-terracotta-army-of-batmen-ogres-and-anthropomorphic-rodents-wit.jpg\" alt=\"picture of some pop culture figures\" />\n\nAccording to Rossof's artist statement, the series is designed to \"playfully explore the concerns of American media's global influence, and China's industry of counterfeiting the copyrighted properties held by said media.\" In other words, if there's a tension between the fact that The Simpsons, Shrek, and Batman are so fully a part of the global consciousness that running off bootleg versions of them for a global audience is a profitable exercise in China, what better way to explore that is there than the medium of terracotta sculpture?\n\nWhether Rossof's intentions speak to you or not, though, the statues themselves are fascinating pieces of work. Mickey's head looks good perched atop a terracotta emperor's body, and the textures of Spider-Man's mask are so well-suited to the medium that it's a wonder it was conceived on pencil and paper. At the very least, if you need an army to guard your thoroughly-Americanized necropolis, you could do a lot worse.\n\nImage : <a href=\"http://www.lerstudio.com/collections/all\" target=\"_blank\">Lizabeth Eva Rossof</a>\nQuote : <a href=\"http://dansolomon.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dan Solomon</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.fastcocreate.com/3038541/build-yourself-a-pop-culture-terracotta-army-of-barts-and-batmen-with-this-artists-statues\" target=\"_blank\">FastCompany</a>",

        "blog_body": "This comes from someone whose father was a programmer at IBM, and worked in the days when a single machine was big enough to fill an entire building. \n\nWhat all the various components are for, and how they all intersect and interact with one another. If you feel the same way, it’s worth taking a look at Kano, a colorful construction set with accessible, LEGO-inspired step-by-step instructions for constructing your very own Raspberry Pi-powered microcomputer.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/02-Kano-Setup-wBackdrop-730x546.png\" alt=\"picture of kano kit 001\" />\n\nThe DIY kit – launching today on Kickstarter is broken up into different ‘levels’, which are spread out over multiple instruction booklets. Owners will be taught not only how to build their mini computer, but also how to design video games, create synth music and learn some basic coding along the way.\n\nThe Kano team started building the first prototype in January this year, in an attempt to make the original Raspberry Pi microcomputer more accessible for first-time PC builders. The final version was developed using feedback from hundreds of different kids, teachers and parents, as well as the Raspberry Pi community (Eben Upton, founder of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is an adviser for Kano) and some of the folks behind learn to code site Codecademy.\n\nKano has been designed so that anyone, regardless of their age, can create a PC and understand its makeup. Its creators are launching a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter today to put it into production: each kit will set you back £69/$99/€79 and if successful, the first units will be shipped to backers in the summer of 2014. A retail release is also on the company’s roadmap.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/kano2-730x444.jpg\" alt=\"picture of kano componance \" />\n\nThe price-tag might sound a little steep, considering that the original Raspberry Pi microcomputer costs only $35. Kano is a far more complete and user-friendly product though: backers can expect a wireless keyboard with multitouch trackpad, an 8GB SDHC card, a modular side slotting case with clamshell clip, an original operating system called Kano OS, a case-mounted GPIO-powered speaker and a series of illustrated instruction booklets out of the box. All of the content for Kano will also be available in English, Spanish and Arabic at launch.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi has triggered a wave of fresh interest in coding, modding and the fundamentals of PC construction. However, it’s still a relatively niche product (over 2 million of them have now been sold, mind you). If you’re looking for a fun, accessible entry point to PC building like I am, Kano is definitely worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNot convinced yet?

Sometimes you think you are on the right path and everything is going smoothly… then out of nowhere, an unexpected obstacle stares you right in the eye. What do you do?\n\nBelow are some early warning signs that you might be in trouble.\n\n<strong>1. Your sales cycles or customer acquisition time is getting longer</strong>\n\nYou may have launched an awesome product, received a lot of buzz and lots people signed up to your mailing list. However, you have noticed your acquisition rates are declining or are starting to take longer than previously.\n\n<strong>2. You don’t really know your end user</strong>\n\nYou created something that you assumed people wanted, people told you they wanted it before you built it, you built it then people said “Cool, I will probably use this one day, good luck with it all!”\n\nYou are still trying to work out why a gush of users didn’t come flocking with open arms.\n\n<strong>3. Your market is gradually shrinking</strong>\n\nBeing in a market that has declining demand rates is not a good idea if you want sustainable long term growth. If you have noticed demand decreasing and it’s nothing to do with your product, competitiveness or pricing strategy, it’s time to rethink the industry you’re in.\n\nDeclining demand is an early warning sign that you might need to consider diversifying into a new market or pivot away from the product or service you currently offer.\n\n<strong>4. You don’t have time to focus on your core product</strong>\n\nYou understand the product is paramount to your success; however, unexpected things have popped up which means that resources and time are now getting allocated to something else.\n\nWhen you deviate away from improving upon your core offering, i.e. your product or service, you might find yourself in trouble later on. Competitors might “come out of nowhere” with a better product offering while you were focusing on “more important things.”\n\n<strong>5. You have no real plans for monetization</strong>\n\nIt’s okay if you don’t want to monetize your product immediately or in the near future, but experimenting with potential monetization options early on gives you insight into probable scenarios regarding how you could profit in the future.\n\nExpecting to just flip a switch on when the “time comes” is slightly naive and you might find yourself with unexpected obstacles. Experimentation improves your learning curve and provides greater insight when you do decide to monetize if you have not already done so.\n\n<strong>6. Price wars are coming your way</strong>\n\nWhen you start feeling your competitors squeezing your last drip of margin real tight, you’re most likely experiencing a price war. This occurs for many reasons, one of which could be that you are in a commodity market, a market driven purely by price differentiation.\n\nThis could be okay if you are prepared to fight back with an ever declining pricing strategy. If you are not in that position, you might find yourself in trouble.\n\n<strong>7. You are getting bored of it all</strong>\n\nIf you are finding that the excitement of running your business is wearing off and the thrill behind creating something of long term value is depreciating, then you’re more than likely in trouble. This is a very early sign of the potential demise of your business.\n\nIf you’re not passionate about your company anymore, it will show in your product and the way you manage your business.\n\nWatching your startup decline is not easy, but as many entrepreneurs will tell you, failure teaches you to succeed. Don’t be discouraged if you find yourself in this position – you may just be experiencing a little serendipity and all might work out in the end.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/acondurache\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Condurache</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/11/10/7-warning-signs-startups-fail/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

After winning Startup Garage and getting space at Invest Ottawa, we never really had any plans to join an accelerator, but when my co-founder and I met Dave in Montreal and found out (literally overnight) that we were in 500 Startups Batch 10, we just couldn’t say no. We had no idea what to expect going into the program since we never formally applied, but man are we glad we jumped on that train.\n\nLet’s put it this way: Gymtrack would not be where it is today without 500 Startups. Plain and simple. For most startups, you go into this accelerator and basically no one’s ever heard of you. You get in and all of a sudden there’s a bunch of articles about you making it into 500 Startups, and 3 months later half of Silicon Valley knows your name—not an easy thing to accomplish as a year-old startup from Ottawa.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Gymtrack-2.jpg\" alt=\"picture of a gentelman doing chest press in the gym\" />\n\nThe brand name alone is huge, bringing you media attention and investor intros. But that’s just the beginning. About 1400 companies applied to Batch 10 of 500 Startups and only 25 or so got in—being able to meet and hang out with the founders of some of the hottest startups in the world is an incredible opportunity. Getting access to their advisors and mentors— people with experience with HR, development, and enterprise sales— is also super helpful. It would take forever to go out and organically create the network that 500 more or less hands over to you on a silver platter.\n\nAnd, to top it all off, there’s Demo Day. I’ve never seen so many angels and VCs in one place before in my life—even Chamillionaire came to watch our pitches. For Gymtrack, the experience was nothing short of amazing, and we were selected as the top startup there by TechCrunch and other news outlets.\n\nFrom media exposure and fundraising to networking with other founders, 500 Startups was an amazing experience. Just don’t expect them to hold your hand or run your business for you…whether you’re in an accelerator or not, the hustle never stops.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/dyWIToa0kcY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.gymtrack.co\" target=\"_blank\">Gymtrack</a> builds a system for gyms that allows members to automatically track their workouts, and creates a platform for virtual personal training.\n\n(This introspective article was written by Pablo Srugo, Co-Founder & Co-CEO at Gymtrack)\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/inkblotca\" target=\"_blank\">Ian Hardy</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.betakit.com/gymtrack-why-joining-500-startups-is-the-best-thing-your-startup-can-do/\" target=\"_blank\">Betakit</a>",

But take the body attached to it on a brisk walk or jog and suddenly your meat-brain is lighting up like a Lite-Brite.\n\n<h3>What Exactly Is Going On In There?</h3>\n\"When we exercise, blood pressure and blood flow increase everywhere in the body, including the brain,\" Justin Rhodes, associate professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign writes in Scientific American. \"More blood means more energy and oxygen, which makes our brain perform better.\"\n\nResearch has long shown that the hippocampus, a squishy seahorse-shaped region found on both sides of the brain that's essential for learning and forming memories, becomes highly activated during exercise. But recent studies have revealed new, more complex and nuanced ways in which exercise activates and affects the brain.\n\n<h3>Beefing Up Your Brain's Information Highway</h3>\nGray matter, the meaty, wrinkly stuff we often think of when we conjure images of the brain, is really only half the story when it comes to understanding what's going on up there. Recent research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign examining both children and older adults shows that the brain's white matter--the network of nerve fibers that connect and transmit brain signals from one part of the brain to another--becomes more fibrous and compact with physical exercise.\n\n\"The more streamlined and compact your white matter is, the faster and more efficiently your brain functions,\" Christopher Bergland writes in Psychology Today. \"The real enemy is sedentarism. … Just a little bit of movement every day helps preserve the integrity of your brain’s white matter.\"\n\n<h3>Connecting Your Head And Your Heart--Literally</h3>\nWe know exercise is good for cardiovascular health, but new research has also shown that a healthy heart has effects on your brain functioning as well--and exercise plays an important role in that connection. The aorta, the main artery in the body that distributes oxygenated blood to our entire system, including the brain, is where the body's arteries begin to stiffen as we get older, according to researcher Claudine Gauthier.\n\nA recent study done by Gauthier and a team of researchers at the University of Montreal, found that older adults who exercised more and whose aortas were in better condition performed better on cognitive tests. \"The preservation of vessel elasticity may be one of the mechanisms that enables exercise to slow cognitive aging,\" according to Gauthier. The lesson here: A healthy heart makes a healthy mind.\n\n<h3>The Connection Between Muscle Activity And Brain Health</h3>\nDuring exercise, our muscles produce a protein called PGC-1alpha. Recent research has shown this protein helps break down kynurenine, a substance in the bloodstream that accumulates as a result of stress, according to the New York Times's Gretchen Reynolds.\n\nGiven that exercise boosts the body's production of PGC-1alpha, which breaks down depression-causing kynurenine, researchers concluded that \"you reduce the risk of getting depression when you exercise,” as Maria Lindskog, one of the neuroscientists involved in the study, put it.\n\n<h3>It Only Takes 20 Minutes</h3>\nWe were born to move, yet sitting sedentary for hours at a time is an unfortunate by-product of our screen-obsessed culture. A big question when it comes to exercise is how long and often one needs to do it in order to reap the benefits. According to Reynolds, who's written a whole book on the topic, it only takes 20 minutes, particularly if you haven't been all that active to begin with. \"The first 20 minutes of moving around, if someone has been really sedentary, provide most of the health benefits,\" according to Reynolds. \"You get prolonged life, reduced disease risk--all of those things come in in the first 20 minutes of being active.\"\n\nIt's not about using exercise as a way to lose weight--it's about becoming more fit and maintaining a health heart and mind. \"If someone starts an exercise program and improves his fitness, even if he doesn’t lose an ounce, he will generally have a longer life and a much healthier life,\" says Reynolds.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/janeporter00\" target=\"_blank\">Jane Porter</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3037894/how-exercise-changes-your-brain-to-be-better-at-basically-everything\" target=\"_blank\">FastCompany</a>",

Sure, sites such as LinkedIn make it easy to look up basic information, while card-scanning apps have eliminated the need for a physical filing system, but the cards themselves have remained more or less unchanged.\n\nAbout.me wants to change that. The startup, which enables users to create simple one-page websites about themselves, rolled out Intro, a new iPhone app that functions as a digital business card. \n\nUnlike LinkedIn, whose users skew more toward the corporate world (what about.me CEO Tony Conrad refers to as \"traditional W-2ers\"), photo-centric about.me tends to attract artists and musicians and those whose skills and experience may not fit into the resume format as well.\n\nAs its name suggests, Intro is focused on enabling those first, often critical, introductions. Log in with your about.me credentials, and the app creates a card with your photo, biography, email and phone number (provided you've shared that information with the service.)\n\nBut unlike social networks, which only allow you to connect with other users, Intro's users can share their information with anyone. What's more, users can choose what type of information they want to share each time.\n\n<img src=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzEwLzI5LzVhL2Fib3V0Lm1laW50LjI2M2MzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/506bcc7f/2be/about.me-intro-app-640x562.jpg\" alt=\"picture of intro app\" />\n\nWe live in a world where almost everyone has a device,\" Conrad said. \"It feels like the time is overdue for somebody to have come in and solved this problem. “It’s obvious [your device] should be your business card.”\n\nEach introduction is saved within the app, so you can quickly find people you've connected with in the past. The app also adds a small amount of contextual information about those connections by displaying the date and location the introduction was made.\n\nThe company's head of product, Ryan Freitas, said about.me isn't trying to eliminate business cards as much as be a professional alternative when you don't have a card, or want to add more context around an interaction. “We’re competing with sending a blank email, or sending a blank text,” he said.\n\nIntro is free and iPhone only for now, but Freitas said an Android app is likely coming. \n\nImage: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/47514124@N02/\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Franklin</a> / Flickr\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karissabe\" target=\"_blank\">Karissa Bell</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/10/30/about-me-intro-app/\" target=\"_blank\">Mashable</a>",

        "blog_body": "<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/photography-book-798x310.jpg\" alt=\"picture of crafting\" />\n\nThis is the third of a series on \"The Guide to Your Online Portfolio,\" and has been brought to you by Squarespace. Create exceptional websites, blogs, portfolios and online stores.\n\nAre you working on designing your new portfolio site or personal website? Unsure of where to start or how to make it look professional? What type of design elements should you focus on when you are working on your site? Designing your online portfolio should best highlight on your portfolio pieces so your work speak for themselves.\n\nHow do you create a portfolio site in a way that the design isn’t really the first thing that is seen? Below, let’s talk about some of the major design decisions that need to be made as you work through designing your new online portfolio to help make sure the focus is always on your work.\n\n<h3>Logo</h3>\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2011/10/logos-520x196.jpg\" alt=\"picture of text\" />\n\nFor your online portfolio, you should consider adding a logo or some graphic mark that signifies who you are and the type of work you do. While this often is a no-brainer for companies or design firms, for individuals and freelancers this may not seem as important.\n\nWhen visitors come to any site, the first thing they look for is a logo or name of the site. This element shouldn’t be skipped simply because you want to place all the focus on your work. If you want a clean, simple logo for your site and haven’t created one, services like Squarespace offers a free professional logo maker with your site.\n\nHaving a nice logo or graphic mark on your portfolio tells your visiting audience several things: that you are professional, that you know how to take care of the details and that you are stable. Your logo will give you a nice professional and polished look while showing visitors that you are offering professional services.\n\nDesigning the small details like your logo shows visitors that you pay attention and make sure even the tiniest of details are taken care of. Finally, those with a logo often appear more stable as they have taken the time to develop a logo because they plan to stick around.\n\nAll of these good vibes are what you want to convey as visitors move down from your logo to the rest of your site.\n\n<h3>Typography</h3>\n\nFor your portfolio website, the type of typography you use will go a long way. Since portfolios are more about the work than your words, you should keep your words at a minimum and where they don’t take focus off of your work.\n\nIf you must use some copy on your website, make sure that it is used to describe your work or yourself and keep it short and sweet.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/typefaces-520x304.jpg\" alt=\"picture of type setting\" />\n\nClean, easy to read and unobtrusive typography works best for your online portfolio. Things to consider when choosing a typeface and using it on your site include: simple and clean letterform (no decorative fonts), colors you choose (more below), spacing around the typography and the font size.\n\nLook into using san-serif fonts, keeping the color a neutral color (grays and blacks work well), and keeping the font size small but where it can be easily read.\n\nWhile on the subject of content, make sure you don’t cram your portfolio site with a lot of copy. It is great to have some description of your work for each portfolio piece, but keep it descriptive and at a minimum.\n\nAlso, be sure to include information about yourself as well, but this is often best on its own page and limited to about two to three paragraphs.\n\n<h3>Color</h3>\n\nThe psychology behind colors in design will help you discover the perfect color palette for your portfolio site. Keeping in mind that the design of your portfolio website itself is to aid in the viewing of your work, selecting colors so that they fade into the background and bring forward your work is the key.\n\nOften, portfolio sites work best when the work is displayed on a white or light gray, or dark gray or black background. Using bright colors tend to distract viewers from seeing your work, so reserve any bright colors to selected areas such as headings.\n\nMany portfolio sites stick to neutral color schemes since they are the cleanest and most effective backdrop for just about any type of work you want to showcase.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/1200x627-details-extended-facebook-ads-hugo-520x271.jpg\" alt=\"picture of a portfolio loaded on laptop screen\" />\n\nMake sure the colors you choose contrast well with your work. If your work is very bright in color, your site should have muted colors. If your work is very muted, using selected bright colors will help draw attention to your work.\n\nIf you use similar color scheme for your portfolio site as you do for your work, then it will cause a competition visually between your work and the site itself, and this is often very visually jarring for visitors.\n\n<h3>Layout</h3>\n\nYour work on your portfolio site should be laid out in a clean and easy-to-follow format. Think about how art galleries showcase work on the walls. Are the pieces crammed together or spread apart? Is the entirety of the space well laid out or does it feel like it was put together last minute?\n\nOrganize your pieces on your portfolio in a way that allows each piece to breath and have its own space. Avoid cramming lots of pieces onto your portfolio page, as this tends to feel very chaotic and unprofessional.\n\nOften, portfolio sites have work laid out in a grid with works spanning two or three images across and how ever many rows needed to show all the work.\n\nIn planning the layout of your site, pay attention to the size of your portfolio images. Visitors are coming to see your work, and they may linger and stay on one or two pieces for a long time.\n\nTo help aid in their viewing, present images are are large enough for them to see the details, but not so large as to be overwhelming and daunting.\n\n<h3>Photos/Graphics</h3>\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/06/vintage-cameras-520x349.jpg\" alt=\"picture of vintage camera\" />\n\nFinally, for your portfolio website, your photos and/or graphics you use on your site to showcase your work need to planned and created keeping in mind their purpose. Visitors want to see your work, so they will often spend time viewing each piece you have. The types of photos and graphics you use should be created in a way that showcases your work in the best possible way.\n\nFor physical pieces, look to take the best photographs you can of your work, using the best camera you have available to you. Take multiple pictures and at multiple angles so you can see which will work best later on.\n\nWhen you go to edit your pictures, feel free to adjust the exposure, contrast, lightness and brightness to help showcase your work in the best light – just don’t go overboard as you don’t want to misrepresent your work.\n\nFor your digital pieces, figure out the best way to showcase the entirety of your work for a project in one image (meaning a thumbnail – you can always have visitors click to see more about that project and more images as you see fit). Layout, crop, and adjust so that visitors understand what they are looking at but also allows the work to be showcased in the best way possible.\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\nTaking your logo, typography, colors, layout and photo/graphic treatment in mind when designing your new portfolio site will help you make sure that your online portfolio is serving its purpose: to place all the focus on your work. Your portfolio site will be the most successful when every design decision made is in favor of showcasing your work.\n\nIf you need help getting started, services like Squarespace can make the setup process easy so you can focus on crafting quality content.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amberlturner\" target=\"_blank\">Amber Leigh Turner</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/10/29/guide-crafting-visual-elements-online-portfolio/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

The secret to bringing out the best in yourself and others is in recognizing communication strength and learning styles.\n\nWe all have our own communication style, and most of us have strength in more than one area.\n\nKnowing how your strengths--and challenges--stack up gives you insight and an awareness to guide you in having more successful conversations.\n\nWhen those who work together understand their own and each others' strengths, they bring out the best in each other and take more risks, respecting individual differences and developing a stronger team where innovation and productivity flourish.\n\nThere is a deep connection between learning styles and communication styles; use this inventory to gain insight into the processing strengths that drive your own personal communication style:\n\n<h3>1. Interpersonal</h3>\n\nYour preferred learning style is interpersonal if you agree with the following:\n\n- It is important for me to get my thoughts and feelings out in the open.\n- Others seek me out for counsel or advice.\n- I am intrigued by emotional dynamics in interpersonal relationships.\n\nA coworker communicating with you might ask you, “What do you know about our customer in terms of what really matters to them?”\n\nIf you are interpersonally driven, then you are tuned into human relationships. You intuitively understand the feelings, motivations, and goals of others. Your understanding of the customer is rooted in the emotional connections you develop.\n\n<h3>2. Intrapersonal</h3>\n\nYour preferred learning style is intrapersonal if you agree with the following:\n\n- Learning about myself is central to my understanding of others.\n- To achieve clarity, I first need to be aware of my feelings, intentions, motivations, and goals.\n- I have a good sense of self-direction and think independently.\n\nA coworker communicating with you might ask you, “What values are we really talking about?”\n\nBecause you are introspective (intrapersonal), you understand the deep values inherent in a situation. You use your inner experience as a means of connecting to others and gleaning the purpose behind what is occurring.\n\n<h3>3. Linguistic</h3>\n\nYour preferred learning style is linguistic if you agree with the following:\n\n- I like to use words.\n- I pay careful attention to the meaning of words.\n- I like explaining, teaching, or persuading others.\n\nA coworker communicating with you might ask you, “What words do we need here?”\n\nBecause your strength lies in conceptualizing in words, your explanations and descriptions are naturally clear and precise.\n\n<h3>4. Logical</h3>\n\nYour preferred learning style is logical if you agree with the following:\n\n- I reason things through step-by-step when thinking and talking.\n- I prefer to follow a train of thought through to its logical conclusion without interruption.\n- I like to find rational explanations for almost everything.\n\nA coworker communicating with you might ask you, “How can we line up the pieces to this to make it hang together?”\n\nYour logical sense automatically lines up processes coherently and efficiently. You understand the sequence of events and have a good grasp of the numbers and how they relate to the flow of a project from beginning to end.\n\n<h3>5. Visual-Spatial</h3>\n\nYour preferred communication style is visual-spatial if you agree with the following:\n\n- I can see things from different angles when I hear a description.\n- I can easily conceptualize the relationship between objects.\n- I often use metaphor to explain something to others.\n\nA coworker communicating with you might ask you, “What’s the big picture look like?”\n\nYou see the big picture because you are visually-spatially strong and look at situations from an aerial view, seeing the relationships between the different parts of the project.\n\n<h3>6. Kinesthetic</h3>\n\nYour preferred learning style is kinesthetic if you agree with the following:\n\n- My sensory experience is very strong.\n- I sense others' feelings and easily absorb their energy.\n- Physical movement helps me process information.\n\nA coworker communicating with you might ask you, “Are there some symbols that pop to mind?”\n\nYou usually “get” the symbolic nature of communication and frequently connect a symbol that draws together the important elements in a project.\n\n<h3>7. Auditory</h3>\n\nYour preferred learning style is auditory if you agree with the following:\n\n- I really notice tone of voice when someone is speaking.\n- I can tell how someone feels by the sound of his or her voice.\n- Music helps me think things through.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.robertketeyian.com\" target=\"_blank\">Robert V.

Crowdfunding project Basepro is trying to tackle both issues at once with its laptop stand, but after spending some time with a prototype, I found that it only solved the storage issue.\n\nBasepro is an anodized aluminum wedge with space for a hard drive inside and a four-port USB 3.0 hub along the edge. The hard drive is powered via USB, so you won’t need an extra power cable for the stand.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/basepro-3-730x389.jpg\" alt=\"picture of basepro stand side shoot\" />\n\nCurrently on Indiegogo, Basepro’s drive-less model comes as a perk for $69 contributions, while a pre-installed 1TB model runs $119. The final retail price for Basepro is expected to cost $119 without the drive and $189 for the 1TB model. 2TB and 4TB editions are also available for $149 and $229, respectively. The company is trying to raise $50,000 through its campaign, but it’s also using flexible funding, so it will receive any funds that are contributed even if it doesn’t reach the mark.\n\nI’m constantly juggling backups and free space on my MacBook Pro, so Basepro’s hard drive feature does come in handy. The external drives I use often end up getting accidentally disconnected when I’m working, sometimes corrupting their data in the process.\n\nThe laptop stand is small enough that you could pack it in your bag when traveling, but that seems like more of a hassle than it’s worth.\n\nMy issue with Basepro is that it walks a questionable compromise between screen height and ergonomics. Absolute, the company behind the device, asserts that the stand enables good posture because it allows your arms and wrists to rest, but the position caused pain in my elbows. The elevated screen does help reduce some neck and back strain, but I found myself still having to look down at the computer even with the stand.\n\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/basepro-1-730x550.jpg\" alt=\"picture of basepro\" />\n\nBasepro is trying to get the best of both worlds. It wants to turn your laptop into a workstation, but it also wants you to keep using your built-in keyboard. You’ll have to decide whether you want to work in a middle zone between hunching over your laptop and using a full docking station with an external monitor and keyboard. By the way, if you do want to use an external monitor with Basepro, you’ll need a USB adapter since the hub doesn’t include Thunderbolt or DisplayPort connections.\n\nIf I were to reconfigure my desk setup for the stand, I’d consider elevating the Basepro, connecting an external keyboard and mouse and then plugging an external monitor directly into my MacBook Pro. That’s a lot of trouble to go through, but it’s a decent docking system that keeps my laptop free to quickly disconnect if I need to head to a meeting.\n\nGiven that most of us could use some posture correction for our computers use, Basepro is a valiant effort. The stand might work for you if you’re experiencing neck and back pain from looking down at your laptop all day, but I’m not convinced that it addresses the wrist and elbow issues that I experience. If you’re on the fence about backing the project, you might want to create mockup using a couple of three-ring binders to see if the incline is comfortable for you. - <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/basepro-the-ultimate-laptop-workstation--2\" target=\"_blank\">Basepro [Indiegogo]</a>\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beijingdou\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Ong</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/10/24/basepro-laptop-stand-hands-built-hard-drive-nice-touch-ergonomics-arent/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>\n\n",

As developers, we might not always remember the underlying concept that's vital to web accessibility: the Document Object Model. The DOM as an object data structure is also important in the world of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Components</a>, a group of new specifications moving through the W3C and into modern browsers.\n\n<img src=\"http://media.creativebloq.futurecdn.net/sites/creativebloq.com/files/images/2014/10/web%20components%20W3C.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Web Components is a collection of new standards that are working their the W3C\" />\n\nThe goals of Web Components include built-in encapsulation, client-side templating and the ability to create your own HTML tags ( taco-button , anyone?) Before we create the next generation of soulless div ; tags, we should consider the <a href=\"http://netm.ag/semantics-256\" target=\"_blank\">role of semantics</a> in shiny, new technologies.\n\n<h3>Adding semantics</h3>\n\nIn browser rendering, HTML tags are parsed and converted into objects with expected behaviour. The interaction between the DOM and a screen reader highlights the importance of a meaningful page structure.\n\nFor example: headings denote a content hierarchy, lists group multiple items, links take users to new references and buttons provide interaction targets. Part of the appeal of Web Components is not having to wait for new browser defaults to be implemented.\n\nIf we are to be trusted with the power to supply the internet with our own custom elements, we must add semantics in order to communicate their purpose and state. We can do this in a few ways:\n\n- Extend existing element prototypes\n- Use semantic elements inside your custom components (button verus div)\n- Use ARIA to add roles, states and properties\n\nShadow DOM is a way to extend the DOM with an encapsulation boundary that styles and scripts (mostly) do not cross. With this specification, we can finally create sandboxed widgets. So what happens when a screen reader or keyboard tries navigating Shadow DOM content?\n\nIt's actually pretty amazing. Because assistive technology encounters pages after they're rendered with CSS and JavaScript, users are presented with a single DOM – a seamless, accessible browsing experience.\n\nYou can create the custom elements of your dreams today with a polyfill such as Polymer or X-Tag to round out modern browser support. Communicate the purpose and state of your elements by extending similar ones or by using ARIA where appropriate. As long as your code follows <a href=\"http://netm.ag/bestpractice-256\" target=\"_blank\">accessibility best practices</a>, your Web Components will be accessible.\n\nQuote : Marcy Sutton\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/how-make-sites-more-accessible-web-components-101413200\" target=\"_blank\">CreativeBloq</a>",

Show attendees were each provided a pair of 3D glasses to view the final five looks of the the label's Spring/Summer 2015 ready-to-wear line.\n\nHowever, the 3D looks at the Rebecca Minkoff show fell flat.\n\nAfter the first 27 ensembles sauntered down the runway in crisp whites and springtime cottons, the lights in the Lincoln Center theater turned low. The glitterati and fashion bloggers donned their 3D glasses in anticipation. Yet when the looks turned the corner, people squinted to spot the illusions.\n\nThe prints were beautiful and modern, to be sure and with the 3D glasses, one could detect a slight, shimmering aura atypical of fabric —unless one was on acid. It could be, however, that it was just too dark in the room to see correctly.\n\nMost people around me ended up taking their glasses off entirely, preferring to appreciate (and Instagram) the styles in their purest form — without the smoke and mirrors.\n\nKnown for its casual, comfortable and feminine garments, but primarily for its handbags and accessories, the label has recently invested more in tech-friendly designs. It announced a pair of stylish smart bracelets, which will retail starting at $120 for the holiday season.\n\n<img src=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzA1LzU5L3JlYmVjY2FtaW5rLjE3NDZlLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/c2d0a276/487/rebecca-minkoff-3d-thumb.jpg\" alt=\"picture of A model and audience members wear 3D glasses as dim lighting is used at the end of the Rebecca Minkoff Spring 2015 collection show during Fashion Week, Friday, Sept. 5, 2014, in New York.\">\n\n<img src=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzA1LzU5L3JlYmVjY2FtaW5rLjg4NGVmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/77c795b3/203/rebecca-minkoff-3d-3.jpg\" alt=\"picture of MERCEDES-BENZ FASHION WEEK\">\n\n<img src=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzA1LzU5L3JlYmVjY2FtaW5rLmQ3ZWEzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/9e846e59/1ee/rebecca-minkoff-3d-4.jpg\" alt=\" MERCEDES-BENZ FASHION WEEK\">\n\n<img src=\"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzA1LzU5L3JlYmVjY2FtaW5rLjRmZDBjLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/26a6076f/92e/rebecca-minkoff-3d-2.jpg\" alt=\"picture of MERCEDES-BENZ FASHION WEEK\">\n\n<img src=\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzA1LzU5L3JlYmVjY2FtaW5rLjJjNTgzLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/c4871a47/4ab/rebecca-minkoff-rehearsal.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Designer Rebecca Minkoff, center, wears 3D glasses as she watches a rehearsal before her Spring 2015 collection show during Fashion Week, Friday, Sept. 5, 2014, in New York.\">\n\nImage : <a href=\"http://www.jasondecrow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason DeCrow</a> / <a href=\"http://www.ap.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Associated Press</a>, <a href=\"http://frazerharrisonphotography.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frazer Harrison</a> / <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Getty Images</a>\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StephMBuck\" target=\"_blank\">Stephanie Buck</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/09/05/rebecca-minkoff-3d-fashion/\" target=\"_blank\">Mashable</a>",

        "blog_body": "Back in the '80s, Lisa Frank inspired an entire generation of kids to cover everything they owned with colorful, neon stickers. Now, some of those kids have grown up to be designers, and there's a new sticker book just for them. Created by two Frog alums, Sticker UI Book makes designing a user interface as fun as slapping rainbow pandas and psychotropic dolphins all over your Trapper Keeper.\n\nThe Sticker UI Book is a slim volume--something like a composition book--that comes with eight pages of stickers designed to resemble common UI elements. They can be stuck on the book's 48 empty pages to brainstorm new user interfaces and apps.\n\n<img src=\"http://h.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/10/3036822-inline-i-2-lisa-frank-inspired-this-sticker-book-for.jpg\" alt=\"picture of sticker ui book\" />\n\nThe Sticker UI Book was created by Brandy Bora and Jennifer Williams of <a href=\"http://www.killerinc.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Killer Inc</a>, two New York-based designers who met at Frog Design in 2009. The pair originally teamed up to try to make a game, but soon found themselves bonding over something else entirely.\n\n\"We were both girls who grew up in the '80s, so as kids, we just loved our Lisa Frank stickers and notebooks,\" Bora tells me. \"The feeling you get from looking over a collection of stickers, and the story each one provides is something that seemed to have stuck with us. I think we both wanted to recreate that feeling of fun with a different aesthetic.\"\n\n<img src=\"http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2014/10/3036822-inline-i-1-lisa-frank-inspired-this-sticker-book-for.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Brandy Bora and Jennifer\" />\n\nTo create the Sticker UI Book, Bora and Williams worked for about a year on nights and weekends, looking at their old wireframe sketches for inspiration and blocking out templates. Then they created a custom set of UI elements, drawing every icon and element to work with page layouts for mobile, tablet, and the web in mind, and sharing them with other designers for feedback.\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/712/410/9851df2ee97b9702d8d2328ec886b9cc_large.png?1412825190\" alt=\"picture of sticker ui book\" />\n\nAlthough the inspiration for the Sticker UI Book is undeniably whimsical, Bora means for it to be a serious design tool. \"We wanted to make sure that the brand has a look and feel that does not draw attention away from the ideas of the sketchers,\" Bora says. \"We hope the finished kit represents a clean design that will help our supporters create wireframes that clearly communicate interactions.\"\n\nWith 22 days to go in a Kickstarter campaign, the Sticker UI Book is trying to meet a $12,500 goal to enter production. If things go well, the Sticker UI Book will ship to backers in November; you can pre-order one now starting at $25.\n\nNow would someone come up with Colorforms for designers next? Please?\n\nImage : <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1040120743/the-sticker-ui-book-by-killer-inc\" target=\"_blank\">KickStarter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stickerui.com/\" target=\"_blank\">StickerUI</a>\nQuote : <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/drcrypt\" target=\"_blank\">John Brownlee</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3036822/making-it/designing-user-interfaces-is-now-as-easy-as-putting-stickers-on-a-trapper-keeper?utm_source=mailchimp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=codesign-daily&position=3&partner=newsletter\" target=\"_blank\">FastCompany</a>",

The Cupertino company is also considering changing the technology behind the service, adding new features and designs, and adding exclusive music — much like the U2 album that can only be streamed on Beats Music, said the people, who asked not to be named because they aren't authorized to talk about the deliberations.\n\nIn June, Apple paid around $3 billion for Beats' music streaming service, high-priced fashionable headphones and line of mobile speakers. At the time, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the acquisition was about the music service, and to gain access to Beats co-founders Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.\n\nApple quietly updated the software on its Apple TV set-top box last week, giving the new Beats Music app prominent placement on the screen. The company is also giving away two-week free trials of Beats Music by signing up through the Apple TV app. Beats Music, which unlike rival Spotify doesn't offer an advertising-supported version, costs $9.99 a month or $99 for a year.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndyFixmer\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Fixmer</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/09/22/apple-weighs-beats-music-change/\" target=\"_blank\">Mashable</a>",

David Butler, Coca-Cola’s vice president of innovation and entrepreneurship, (who has <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Design-Grow-Coca-Cola-Learned-Combine/dp/1451671822\" target=\"_blank\">written a book</a> with Tischler) announced the <a href=\"http://coca-colafounders.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola Founders</a> program, a way for startups to gain access to Coca-Cola's tremendous reach and for Coca-Cola to tap the ideas of independent entrepreneurs. The company goes into startup communities around the world and hand-selects founders, giving them insider access to Coca-Cola--both the company’s assets and its challenges. The founders’ ideas are then shaped by what they see inside Coca-Cola.\n\n“It allows us to move much faster than we could internally using the least amount of money,” Butler said. “What they struggle with is scale,” he said--something that Coca-Cola does better than almost any company around. According to Butler, Coca-Cola is local in 207 countries, and sells roughly two billion servings of its products a day. The ideas--all still in development--that have emerged from the initiative include a food startup in Berlin, a mobile convenience store, and even a company related to wearables.\n\n“The normal model working with a startup, you’re trying to find your strategic partnerships,” Butler said. “Startups come to big companies and try to get in. On the big company side, they pitch their thing, but how do we connect that [to what Coca-Cola does]? It’s very difficult.”\n\nWith the Coca-Cola Founders program, he said, “We’ve designed a new way to create startups”--one that not only helps grow Coca-Cola as a company, but allows them to churn out new products and services faster and cheaper.\n\nImage : <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/basheertome/4654889707\" target=\"_blank\">Basheer Tome</a> / Flickr\nQuote : <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/shaunacysays\" target=\"_blank\">Shaunacy Ferro</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3037153/innovation-by-design/coca-cola-launches-new-program-to-recruit-startup-founders\" target=\"_blank\">FastCompany</a>",

        "blog_body": "Marvel Comics turned 75 this year (so did Batman, but he's DC so we'll skip that for now), and some students in France have created one super-sized birthday present for them. It's a website called Ultimate75th that compiles data from each and every year of the franchise's existence in a super-cool visual format.\n\n<img src=\"http://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/10/14/ef344501-22ab-46bb-aead-a802dd83342a/resize/770x578/1a3d1606493f33d8d3e6c8a70fccb39c/screen-shot-2014-10-14-at-10-29-34-am.png\" alt=\"picture of Ultimate75th.com\">\n\nSay hello to Ultimate75th.com and goodbye to your work day.\n\nThe project was created by second-year students at France's Hétic school, the first school in France dedicated to Internet-based careers. The students were tasked to create the site using something known as REST API, which basically means they had to use Marvel's own site architecture. The students themselves must have a touch of the super-human in them because they completed the project in just four days.\n\nTake a dive in and you'll see why that's so remarkable. The site's basic interface is a calendar. Click on a year and you'll get a visual representation of how many Marvel heroes and series existed at that time along with a breakdown of new and existing series and heroes.\n\n<img src=\"http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-marvel141014/1.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Marvel comics books\">\n\nYou'll also get a brief bit of trivia. For example, 1986 says: \"Howard the Duck, a quick-witted talking fowl introduced in the 70s by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik, becomes the first Marvel character to be featured in a theatrical film since Captain America in the 1940s. The iconic George Lucas produced the movie while Lea Thompson and Tim Robbins starred.\"\n\nHover over the heroes and click, and you get taken to a page that shows you all the existing heroes at the time in nifty little circles. Click on those, and you get awesome bios of each one. Hover over the series and click and you'll get comic book covers from each. Clicking those gives a complete profile of the series.\n\nThe site pulls you in like a light-gobbling black hole as you explore the rich history of one of the most well-loved comics creators in history, so it's going to take some true super powers to stop browsing and get back to work. Don't say we didn't warn you.\n\nImage : <a href=\"http://ultimate75th.com/\">Ultimate75th</a>\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/writermfranco\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Franco</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.cnet.com/news/students-build-marvel-75-year-compendium-website-productivity-dies/\" target=\"_blank\">CENT</a>",

And that’s where <a href=\"http://thegridsapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grids</a>, a new Instagram client app from <a href=\"http://thinktimecreations.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Think Time Creations</a> that just hit the Mac App Store, comes into play.\n\nIf you value the look of your Instagram feed and often check it out on the desktop, the makers of Grids are betting that it will be worth $1.99 to you to see all entries in a clean, flexible interface that works with any size screen and full screen mode and supports Retina displays. The difference is the ability to view all the images end-to-end without distracting white space, or set parameters like image size, image spacing, and background color to your own vision.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-13-at-5.10.30-PM-730x694.png\" alt=\"picture of instagram web app\">\n\nA top icon bar facilitates all functions: It lets you click to switch between your feed, popular entries, favorites, images shot nearby and your own collection. You can, of course mark favorites, make comments and follow people. It will even notify you when new entries are posted to your feed.\n\nFrom the main bar you can also search for users and hashtags and bookmark people, locations, hashtags and individual photos and videos without having to follow anyone. You can also see who followed you and what your contacts have been viewing, commenting on and marking as favorites.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-13-at-6.21.21-PM-730x726.png\" alt=\"picture of general menu on ios\">\n\nGrids provides a sleek and streamlined way to work with Instagram while enhancing the beauty of its images.

Jinn is currently in operation in London, offering one-hour deliveries from stores and restaurants, but Pocket Shop both launched and shuttered in the UK capital last year after struggling to find enough regular customers.\n\nAs with all of its startups, Rocket Internet says that it plans to expand ShopWings to more cities and countries quickly assuming it proves successful.

Additionally, it’s introducing multiple sign-in to help users switch between personal and work accounts more easily.\n\nGoogle is also making moves to improve certificate management for wireless connections, while it’s making it easier to set up new workers with Chrome apps by making it easier for admins to push bookmarks and other settings to each device. You can read a full list of the new features and services here.\n\nIn terms of pricing, Google says enterprise customers can procure these advanced features with a new annual subscription, which will cost $50 per device per year.

It’s shaped like a squarish hockey puck and comes in seven colors: Black, Horizon Blue, Fluoro Red, Cargo, Navy, Lemon Lime and Ion Green. Ridiculous descriptors, we know.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.fat-cow.net/images/uploads/sol-bluetooth-speakers.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Sol Bluetooth speakers\" height=\"474\" width=\"730\"  />\n\nThe Punk comes with line-in and line-out ports, making it simple to connect non-Bluetooth devices, as well as a quarter-inch threaded mount for attaching to a bicycle or camera mount. Of course, all of this is irrelevant if the speaker sounds like garbage. Sol Republic says the Punk speaker maintains its “signature sound,” which will obviously appeal or discourage you depending on your experience with its headphones or larger “Deck” Bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe Punk has a 60-foot wireless range and is available now for $69.99 at Best Buy, RadioShack, Sol Republic’s website and other retailers.\n\nOfficial Site : <a href=\"http://solrepublic.com/shop/punk-wireless-bluetooth-speaker.html?icn=punk&ici=2000x425banner&_ga=1.145756084.1866917430.1411486579\" target=\"_blank\">Sol Republic Punk</a>\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nisummers\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Summers</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/09/23/sol-republic-launches-ruggedized-ultra-portable-punk-bluetooth-speaker-69-99/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

This is the dynamic stylesheet language.\n\nIn simple terms, LESS allows you to write CSS in a smarter way by combining functions, mixins, operations and more. This means you write more concise style information and can reuse things like colors and styles more easily. The Pro edition of the Web Workbench supports generating CSS files automatically rather than needing to do JavaScript parsing.\n\nThankfully the Web Workbench includes all the requirements and is a nice simple one install way of working with LESS.",

CBS tried but failed to turn the Shit My Dad Says Twitter feed into a successful TV show, but that 2010 effort proved to be a bust, despite having internet-loved William Shatner toplining the project. Meanwhile, E!'s Rich Kids of Beverly Hills had slightly better luck, with the Instagram-inspired reality show set to return for a second season.\n\nThe series is scheduled to premiere in January 2015.

How? By covering glass in a material that captures energy from the invisible parts of the light spectrum, but still lets in visible light. In other words: translucent solar cells.\n\n\"When you look at tall buildings, there is a tremendous amount of surface area. They can act as efficient collectors throughout the day,\" says Richard Lunt, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at Michigan State University. \"In many buildings, we are already installing films to reject infrared light to reduce [heating and cooling] costs. We aim to do something similar while also generating power.\"\n\nMolecules in the film absorb energy and \"glow.\" The glowing infrared light is then pushed to the sides, where it's converted to electricity using edge-mounted strips of solar cells.\n\nLunt has co-founded a company, Ubiquitous Energy, to commercialize his team's work. He reckons we could see the first applications within five years.\n\nIt's likely the films won't be as efficient as solar panels, even today's relatively inefficient versions. At the moment, they convert only about 1% of incoming energy, compared to a typical rate of 20% for today solar panels. But the films could be cost-effective if spread over large areas--say on the side of skyscrapers. They could also be a useful addition to tablets and smartphones.\n\n\"Ultimately we want to make solar harvesting surfaces that you do not even know are there,\" Lunt says.\n\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.fastcoexist.com/3034696/totally-transparent-solar-cells-could-turn-our-windows-into-solar-panels\" target=\"_blank\">FastCompany</a>\nQuote : <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/btschiller\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Schiller</a>",

Most of them are power banks of different forms and sizes, which are either bulky or unable to fully charge your gadget.\n\nThat’s where <a href=\"http://oivo.pw/\" target=\"_blank\">Oivo</a> comes in, a Slovenian startup offering an elegant solution for those who drain their iPhone’s battery too fast.\n\nThe $39 gadget that the startup is raising money <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1087072919/oivo-the-smallest-charger-on-the-go-for-iphone\" target=\"_blank\">on Kickstarter</a> for is basically a power bank for iPhone with four standard AA batteries, but it’s not bulky at all and is intended to be used as a key fob.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/08/oivo_100-730x486.jpg\" alt=\"picture of oivo 1\">\n\nThe charger consists of two halves, between which the batteries can be installed. When being used, the gadget seems to fit the palm quite comfortably so that user can make calls or browse the Internet. In addition to that, Oivo works as a stand in both portrait and landscape orientation.\n\nThe main element of the gadget are 10 strong neodymium magnets that keep the two halves of the charger together. Oivo’s team claims the magnets are perfectly safe for both the iPhone and any credit cards that happen to be in its vicinity.\n\n<img src=\"http://www.fat-cow.net/images/uploads/56a0e6014e3c178b8bedefda22083084_large.jpg\" alt=\"picture of oivo 2\">\n\nThe team behind the project says Oivo charges an iPhone as fast as any AC charger. A set of normal Duracell alkaline batteries would bring your iPhone up to about 50 percent, while a lithium GP is enough to fully charge the smartphone.\n\nWith a built-in Lightning connector, Oivo works with iPhone 5, 5s, and 5c, and the team claims it will be compatible with the upcoming ‘iPhone 6′ (or whatever it ends up being called). We’ll reserve judgment on that until the new phone is actually released, though.\n\nThere’s no Android version on offer yet, though the team suggests those who would like to see it make a “symbolic pledge of $2,” adding that it might offer a Micro USB version of the charger as a stretch goal.\n\nOivo’s team, based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, says that shipments will start in December 2014 so backers should be able to receive the charger before Christmas.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shlema\" target=\"_blank\">Andrii Degeler</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/09/02/oivo-iphone-kickstarter-aa-batteries/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

One such tool is Elcomsoft’s Phone Password Breaker (EPPB). Elcomsoft calls its software an “ideal solution for law enforcement and intelligence organizations,” but it has gained popularity among users trying to steal private data from others. While attackers would still need to gain the account details through other methods, EPPB also advertises a password-free feature that involves skimming an authentication token from a synced PC or Mac.\n\nElcomsoft has been around for years now, so this technique isn’t anything new, but these shady tactics have surfaced with the attention that this latest leak has brought. We’ve reached out to Apple and Elcomsoft to ask about EPPB and iCloud and will update as needed.\n\nImage : <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/attendees-walk-by-a-sign-for-the-new-icloud-during-the-2011-news-photo/115287922#\" target=\"_blank\">Getty Images</a>\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/beijingdou\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Ong</a>\nSource : <a href=\"thenextweb.com/apple/2014/09/03/hackers-reportedly-using-law-enforcement-tool-download-users-icloud-backups/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

The iconic 15-year-old Microsoft instant messaging service for desktops will finally be laid to rest after its closure was announced in China, the last market where it remains active.\n\nMicrosoft began migrating Messenger users to Skype in January 2013, before the service was retired in March that year. It was left open in China, mainly because it is operated by local partner TOM and not the US company itself, but the ax will fall on the Chinese service when it closes on October 31, as Technode reports.\n\nUsers in China are also being encouraged to switch over to Skype with the offer of free calls. It isn’t clear how many users MSN Messenger has in China, but times have definitely changed and Tencent’s WeChat app — which counts 438 million active users — leads the country’s messaging space in today’s smartphone-centric era.\n\nImage : <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/verborrea/2084029598\" target=\"_blank\">Manolo Gómez</a> / Flickr\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonrussell\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Russell</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/asia/2014/08/29/microsofts-iconic-msn-messenger-closing-china-last-market-remains/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

Instead of focusing on your huge end goal, he explains, think about how you can boil it down to the smallest action step possible. And he means the absolute smallest—so small it sounds stupid. For him, that meant paring down his goal to get fit and work out 30 minutes a day to a goal to do one pushup a day. Just one! The results? He now goes to the gym three to six times a week and is much healthier.\n\nThe reason this works is because it gets us over the biggest hurdle—getting started. Once we've begun, it's a lot easier and more natural to keep going.\n\nSo, think about a professional goal you've been meaning to start or a project that you've been putting off for months. Then boil it down to the absolute smallest step, and aim to do that.\n\nYou might just surprise yourself.\n\nImage : <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-162924065/stock-photo-young-fitness-man-doing-push-ups-on-hardwood-floor.html\" target=\"_blank\">Shutterstock</a>.\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erinaceously\" target=\"_blank\">Erin Greenawald</a>\nSource : <a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-power-of-small-stupid-goals/\" target=\"_blank\">The Muse</a>",

The Nokia 130 sports an MP3 player, an FM radio and can play movies from an SD card because there’s no internet. The company claims the handset supports 46 hours of audio playback, and 16 hours of movie watching. The 1.8-inch phone also comes with a (basic) color display, a claimed 13 hours of talk time, and in single- or dual-SIM versions.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/08/Nokia-130-Single-SIM.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Nokia has Music Player App's on\">\n\nDespite the less-than-impressive specs, the device is interesting because it appears to go against the focus on Windows Phone. That could be because the launch had been planned for some time by Nokia, but by letting this phone get released, Microsoft is hinting that it still has plans for the entry-level tier segment – where margins are low, but Nokia’s brand remains strong among consumers.\n\nUpdate: <a href=\"http://recode.net/2014/08/11/microsoft-decides-to-keep-selling-ultra-low-end-phones-debuts-25-nokia-130/\" target=\"_blank\">In an interview with Re/Code</a>, Microsoft phone unit VP Jo Harlow says the company will retain Nokia’s entry-level phone business because “Microsoft doesn’t have any other project that can reach these consumers.” Harlow believes that these cheap devices can serve  as a bridge that brings new users into Microsoft’s ecosystem.\n\nThe device is available in some colorful options, and is due for release this quarter. The company hasn’t confirmed which markets it will be sold in, but we’d expect it to surface in regions like Africa, Latin America, South Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\nWe’ve reached out to Microsoft for further information about its plans for Series 30 devices, will update this post with any response that we’re given.\n\nIn the meantime, if you’re curious about the Nokia 130, the video below will give you a rundown.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/a6SX3Gxbawc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonrussell\" target=\"_blank\">Jon Russell</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2014/08/11/microsoft-isnt-out-of-the-entry-level-market-yet-after-announcing-a-25-nokia-feature-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

Batteries are finite, and we are forced to plug-in every so often to recharge.  Yes, there are charging phone cases, but those are only a bit more finite than the phone battery itself. Yes, there are even charging mats now, but your phone still needs to be stationary and connected to the mat for it to charge.\n\n<img src=\"http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/53e245e16bb3f79954d6c968-1200-924/meredith-perry-ubeam.png\" alt=\"picture of Meredith Perry, founder of uBeam\">\nBut now we may truly be able to be truly cordless, thanks to the work of Meredith Perry and uBeam.\n\nAs an astrobiology student at the University of Pennsylvania, Perry wound up working on a project unrelated to her major when she showed up for class with a dead laptop and no power cord, according to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/08/23/139854129/young-entrepreneur-has-a-better-idea-now-what\" target=\"_blank\">NPR</a>. She was frustrated enough to start uBeam and think of a solution.\n\nAfter winning an invention competition at UPenn, she decided to move forward with the company full-time after she graduated. And now, three years later and with $1.7 million in seed funding from Marissa Mayer, Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz — plus an upcoming Series A round — Perry is close to making uBeam a reality, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe technology behind uBeam converts electricity to sound and sends it through the air over ultrasound. A receiver catches the waves and converts it back to electricity to power up devices in the room. It cannot beam electricity through walls, however.\n\nThis means you could freely walk around a room (or store) while your phone powers up.\n\nOn Wednesday, uBeam announced its first fully functional prototype that's ready to build for consumers. The chargers, which are 5 millimeters thick, can be inconspicuously attached to a wall, and the receivers to phones and other devices — meaning that individual devices would need the receiver to be charged.\n\nPerry hopes to bring the uBeam products to stores within the next two years. The company is working on a residential, smaller version for individual homes as well as a larger, industrial version for crowded venues like conference halls and airports.\n\nUBeam is currently filing 18 patents with the US Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n\"You’ll never need a cord again, and you won’t need international charging adapters,\" Perry told The New York Times. \"In addition to your local coffee shop saying it has free Wi-Fi, it will also say it has free uBeam.\"\n\nHere's the whole uBeam team: \n\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BpTMP02CUAAkSxC.jpg\" alt=\"picture of the whole uBeam team\">\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@borisonr\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Borison</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/meredeith-perry-ubeam-wireless-charging-2014-8#ixzz39iik0z2O\" target=\"_blank\">BusinessInsider</a>",

Friends immediately knew something wasn't right. \n\nThree-year-old Rylee Taylor is all smiles in the photo below, but take a look at her left eye. It seems to be glowing.\n\n<img src=\"http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/533d63e66bb3f7d7020c7562-634-423/facebook-81.jpg\" alt=\"picture of Facebook / Tara Taylor\">\n\nMost people would assume the glow was a result of light bouncing off the camera lens, but some of Taylor's friends knew better and got in touch immediately after coming across the photo on Facebook.\n\n“They said: ‘Hey, I’m sure it’s nothing. It’s probably the lighting, but your daughter’s eye is glowing and you might want to have it checked out because it’s a sign there could be an issue with her eye,’” Taylor told Memphis news outlet WREG.\n\nThe New York Post reported Rylee was diagnosed with Coats’ disease after her mom took her to the doctor.  Coats' is a very rare condition that can cause blindness or partial loss of vision in one or both eyes. Luckily, if it's detected early enough, it can be prevented.  Doctors say the main problem with Coats' is that its symptoms are hard to spot, even for the individual suffering from the disease.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/zw4OOleJlMM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nVision gradually deteriorates in one eye, and then moves over into the other eye. Since the victims of Coats' are usually very young, they aren't always aware of what's happening until it's too late.\n\nThanks to the power of sharing on Facebook, Rylee Taylor was able to get the medical attention and necessary treatment.",

Yes, a pair of Beats comes with a high price tag (the baseline model costs $199.99), and some argue, low sound quality–still Beats are everywhere.\n\nWhile many want to own the latest fad–others want something unique and one of a kind. Normal, the custom 3D printed earphone company launched by former Quirky member Nikki Kaufman, might have what those folks are searching for. For $199.99, Normal will build you a set of headphones tailored to every weird curve and bend of your earlobe. Each pair is unique—even your right earphone will differ from your left.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Bertoni</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/07/08/these-custom-3-d-printed-headphones-offer-antidote-to-apples-beats/\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes</a>",

In a snub to its competitors, Lei said that Xiaomi has striven to make the Mi Band stand out with a few key features — in particular, it can last 30 days on a full charge, and is waterproof with an IP67 standard.\n\n<img src=\"http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/07/BtIpkjwCcAAizEo-520x292.jpg\" alt=\"picture of mi band with different color selection\">\n\nAnother nifty feature is that the Mi Band can even unlock a Xiaomi smartphone, eliminating the inconvenience of having to key in your password multiple times a day.\n\nStrangely enough, Lei barely touched on the “fitness” aspect of the Mi Band though.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Xiaomi is competing mainly on price as it hopes for this new fitness tracker to appeal to its loyal fan base. However, as wearables start taking off, the Mi Band with its long battery life, several designs and attractive price, looks set to be popular even beyond Mi fans.\n\nLei revealed future plans for the Mi Band include making it into a personal ID — so it can unlock your door when you come home, or switch on smart appliances and gadgets, for example.\n\nLei also has bold ambitions for the gadget to be the “world’s most popular fitness band” — let’s see what will happen as it goes on shelves, as Lei didn’t reveal any specific dates for when it will start going on sale, not to mention international launch plans.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaylenehong\" target=\"_blank\">Kaylene Hong</a>\nSource : <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2014/07/22/xiaomi-announces-first-wearable-device/\" target=\"_blank\">TNW</a>",

According to AppleInsider the company has filed a suit claiming trademark infringement, and is demanding several billion dollars in damages.\n\nBeats claims that a number of Chinese counterfeiters are selling products designed to look like the company’s own headphones and featuring the official Beats trademark. The fake headphones are reportedly sold online through digital storefronts pretending to be connected to the American company. The lawsuit estimates these sites make over $135 billion per year while ruining the Beats brand with low-quality products.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Beats has gone after counterfeiters. In 2013 a similar lawsuit led to the seizure of 50 PayPal accounts and 1,427 domain names, though the company wasn’t actually paid for damages. With Apple set to take over Beats, it’s unclear if the company will continue filing lawsuits to protect its trademarks in China, though for now it looks like Dr. Dre is committed to taking on his counterfeiters at least one more time.\n\nQuote : <a href=\"http://twitter.com/jacobkleinman\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob Kleinman</a>\nSoruce : <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/07/11/beats-sues-chinese-counterfeiters-for-billions-as-apple-sale-nears-completion\" target=\"_blank\">AppleInsider</a>",
